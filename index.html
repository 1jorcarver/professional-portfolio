                Hello! Welcome to my website! I currently live in Salt Lake City on the campus of the University of Utah with my wife, two boys, one girl, and dog. I am an adjunct professor at Iowa Western Community College in Sports Psychology and Psychology. In addition, I am a volunteer coach for the men’s and women’s soccer programs at Salt Lake Community College. I hope you find this website helpful in determining my abilities as a web developer.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                My background in the web development world started in 2020 with the University of Utah’s Coding Bootcamp. However, prior to coding, I was the Head Men's Soccer Coach at Iowa Western Community College. I led the men's team to a national championship in 2013. Since 2008, I have served in multiple leadership roles at Iowa Western, for Council Bluffs Soccer Club, and United Soccer Coaches.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                As you can see, my background in coding is relatively young. However, my professional experiences have spanned over a decade where I worked collaboratively as a team leader and player. Because of these experiences, coupled with my coding education and abilities, I am a candidate of high impact for your company.
            </p>
